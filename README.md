I developed a responsive, single-page informational website for the NEST Cluster at IIT Guwahati. The site features a professional header, a descriptive "About" section, and a dynamic "Activities" section showcasing event cards. I designed the layout using a clean, academic "Blue-on-White" theme to ensure the NEST Cluster branding stands out and remains professional on both mobile and desktop devices.

Tools Used
HTML5: For semantic page structure.

CSS3: Utilizing Flexbox and CSS Grid for a responsive layout and modern UI interactions.

Google Sheets: For structured data management of event titles, dates, and statuses.

GitHub Pages: Used for hosting the live site.

Future Improvement
If given more time, I would implement dynamic data fetching using an API (like SheetDB). This would allow the website to automatically update its "Activities" cards whenever the Google Sheet is edited, eliminating the need for manual code changes.
